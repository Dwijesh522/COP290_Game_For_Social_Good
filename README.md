						     Game Design Document
OVERVIEW:

	spreading awareness towards solid waste management.
The game will start with a story, making aware the player about the social cause, what are the issues, what are the ideal
solutions, what is happening in the real world, what is his/her role/responsibility towards the issue.  In each of the levels,
first, the player will get to learn some high level idea related to the social cause and will be tested through corresponding
level. The last level will be the combination of all the levels and here the creativity and the context understanding of the
player will be tested.
	    
	
Target platform/ Minimum Hardware:
	Our target platform for the game will be Windows. We will use unity as an engine. Any player having age more than 10 years will be
able to play the game because we will first teach and then ask them to play in each level.
	
Visual style:
	The game will have some videos, different types of wastes, shops, tools for the solid waste management, charecters, houses,
kitchen, garden, government related buildings etc.
	
Audio Styles:
	We will use Music Genres according to the events occuring. We will have some charecters having dialogues and will guide the
 players at specific events.
	
Game start- Main Menu- Charecter Selection:
	Single player game. Menu will contain the following options: Play, buy, controls settings, GDD, exit. Player will earn coins
according to his/her performance during solid waste management. To complete all the levels player might has to buy some tools.
They can sell also. They will be given some initial coins and tools.
	  
	
Game Start and Intro:
	There is only single player option. Tutorial levels: There will be few levels to get started and understand the context and
concept. Each tutorial level will start with introducing a concept in an interactive way followed by a testing. In this testing,
player has to use the taught concepts in order to get atleast some threshhold coins to clear the level. Around 3-4 levels will
be dedicated to tutorial levels. Initially the information will be provided to player through the videos and during the game
through the voice (some inbuild charecters talking) and through the text (like a captions). Once the tutorial levels end,
player will have one-final round which will test the playerâ€™s overall understanding, creativity, social qualities. This level
will start from the scratch and will end up with coming up with good product/idea for the solid waste management.
